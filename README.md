# SpiritualPlaces_inIndia
I'm thrilled to share my first mini project with linkedIn connections...a serene and soulful website dedicated to the rich tapestry of India's top 12 Calm havensâ€”a harmonious fusion of tradition and intricate nature of places.
ðŸŒ¿âœ¨...Built with love using HTML and CSS.

Every new project is like starting a new adventure in learning. As I work on exciting things, I discover and get better at new stuff. Come along with me on this journey of getting smarter! ðŸš€ðŸ’¡

The initial project in any technology holds a special place. Today, I'm excited to share my #First #HTMLCSS project with all of you.
